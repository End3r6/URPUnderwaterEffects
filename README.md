# Demo

# How to use
Download the latest release or download from the green code button.

All effects are render features, so just add the one you want. The Horizon Line Feature needs to be the first one called. In order for the effects to be drawn under the water, set a layer on the object and use that layer in the horizon pass.

# Other Effects
Bubbles are included, they are a particle prefab.

# Extenstion
If you wish to add more effects on top of the existing ones, you need to sample the _HorizonLineTexture. This lets you seperate the waterline from the air above the water.
